This repository provides machine learning for detecting license numbers. The aim of this project is to help the security sector find stolen motors by tracking where motors pass on the road. The process involves capturing footage from CCTV cameras, sending it to a computer server, and utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify the license numbers. This allows the authorities to search for vehicles using their license plate numbers via a mobile phone application.

### Background
The market for license plate recognition and vehicle tracking solutions is growing rapidly, driven by the increased demand for security and monitoring measures in elite neighborhoods, parking lots, and businesses. Intelligent PlateTrack will target these segments, including gated communities, private residences, parking facilities, retail outlets, and corporate campuses. Our LPR app stands out from competitors through its advanced OCR technology, real-time tracking, user-friendly interface, and robust security measures. It offers features such as license plate extraction, timestamping, data analytics, and seamless integration with security systems.
