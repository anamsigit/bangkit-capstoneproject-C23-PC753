This repository provides machine learning for detecting license numbers. The aim of this project is to help the security sector find stolen motors by tracking where motors pass on the road. The process involves capturing footage from CCTV cameras, sending it to a computer server, and utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify the license numbers. This allows the authorities to search for vehicles using their license plate numbers via a mobile phone application.
